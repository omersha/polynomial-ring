A C++ library for working with multivariate polynomials (with a Python binding). It is rather drafty. Includes:
* Monomial Ordering: Lexicographical, Graded Lexicographica, Graded Reverse Lexicographical.
* Term-wise polynomial multiplication.
* Polynomial Long Division w.r.t a set of divisors (quotients and a remainder).
* Groebner Basis via Buchberger's Algorithm.
* Minimization and Reduction of a Groebner Basis.
* Finding a standard monomial basis for a coordinates-algebra (given the Groebner Basis of the Ideal).
